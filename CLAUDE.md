# SE Manager Hub — project notes for Claude

## Run

```bash
py app.py
```

Use `py`, not `python` — on this machine `python` resolves to the Windows
Store alias and fails.

## Architecture rules

- SQLite via thread-local connections (`db._get_con()`), same pattern as
  NaughtRFP's `db.py` — never add a `check_same_thread=False` workaround
  elsewhere, it's already handled in the connection layer.
- All httpx clients calling the LiteLLM proxy need `verify=False` — Okta's
  corporate proxy does SSL inspection and breaks default cert verification.
- Model names live in `reviews.py` as a constant (`_MODEL`) — never hardcode
  a model string anywhere else.
- Slack sync must use a **user token**, not a bot token — `search.messages`
  is user-token-only in the Slack Web API.
- Jordan Taylor (and any other departed rep) must never be presented as an
  active/current direct report. Their historical deals stay visible in the
  dashboard — pipeline data is real regardless of who's assigned — but the
  Team page's active/inactive flag governs who counts as "current team" for
  review generation.

## Git workflow

Push to GitHub only — `git push origin master`. Do NOT sync this repo into
a local Desktop folder. GitHub is the single source of truth.

## Docs

Always update README.md after any non-trivial feature change. Work in small
chunks with a visible task list.
